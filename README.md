# Integrating `tailwindcss` with a `gatsby.js` starter

## Motivation

I decided to develop [`aperitivo`](https://github.com/loopsideuk/aperitivo), because I need a consistent basis for kickstarting `gatsby.js` site devlopment. One of the features I want to integrate most into `aperitivo` is the excellent utility class based library [`tailwindcss`](https://tailwindcss.com/).
